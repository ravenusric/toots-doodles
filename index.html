            <h2 class="content-title">Puppy Power</h2>
            <p class="puppy">My husband,Daniel and I have been raising our 6 kids here in Gastonia. We all have a deep love for our
                fur-babies. Especially me some time ago I decided to get a golden doodle and instantly fell in love
                with that breed. With each addition to our family(kids) also came a fur baby. We now have 5 dogs and 2
                cats out of which is 1 golden doodle,Mia and 2 poodles, Grayson and Bailey. Our fur babies grew up with
                just as much love as our Own babies, and are treated as such. We will only accept great loving homes
                for our babies and only want them to be loved as much as we love them. They will have a lot of
                interaction as they get older so they will be well adjusted to just about any situation. Once they
                start moving about and weaning from their moms, they have their own gated play area to enjoy. Once they
                are fully weaned and still waiting for their furever homes they will be running around and playing with
                our kids.
                These beautiful dogs are also a lot of upkeep as well. They will need routine vet checks as well as
                grooming,chew toys, etc. so please be knowledgeable of those things when considering adopting , as we
                said we only want them to go to loving homes.
                When you come to visit these babies it’s not about you choosing them, it’s gonna be more of them
                choosing you as well to make sure everyone is happy.
                Please feel free to contact at anytime with questions and updated pictures will be loaded regularly of
                luvable furever babies.
                From our family to yours
                Chasity and Daniel Hufton & kids.</p>
            <p class="puppy">All puppies will of course be vet checked at 6 weeks old and they will have their tails docked at 4 days
                old per our vet recommendation. They will all be up to date on all vaccines and worming and I will
                attempt a potty-training process with them as well prior to rehoming.</p>
